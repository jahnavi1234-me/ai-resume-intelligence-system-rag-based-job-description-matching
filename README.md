# AI Resume Intelligence System
RAG-Based Job Fit Analyzer
## Project Overview

Recruiters often spend significant time manually reviewing resumes and comparing them with job descriptions to determine candidate suitability. This process is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale when dealing with large volumes of applications.

This project presents an AI-powered Resume Intelligence System that automatically analyzes resumes and evaluates how well a candidate fits a specific job role using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The system leverages vector search, transformer embeddings, and large language models to retrieve relevant resume content and generate a job fit score with explanation.
## Problem Statement

Modern hiring pipelines receive thousands of resumes for each job posting, making manual evaluation inefficient and prone to bias.

Traditional keyword-based resume screening systems often fail to capture semantic similarity between candidate skills and job requirements.

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent resume analysis system that:

Understands resume content

Matches resumes with job descriptions

Retrieves relevant resume segments

Generates a Job Fit Score (0–100)

Provides a clear explanation for the score

This system helps automate early-stage candidate screening using LLM-powered reasoning.

## Project Objectives

Build an AI system to analyze resumes automatically

Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture

Convert resume text into vector embeddings

Store vectors in a FAISS vector database

Retrieve relevant resume chunks using semantic search

Generate job fit scoring and explanation using an LLM

Build an interactive Streamlit interface

## System Architecture

The project follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:
